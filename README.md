cuddle or hide on PT is okay if you ask first. Do NOT pull me into roleplays, canon x canon or oc x canon if you see me. The golden exception to this rule is my friends but even then it's silly/crackhead rp. I don't have the roleplay tag for a reason, I won't sit with you and make your Chrisker ship canon. You have fanfiction for that.

Use tone tags if we don't know eachother to minimize confusion! 

I hide/block freely so if you behave like a clown you will be sent back to your circus
